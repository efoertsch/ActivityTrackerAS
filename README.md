# ActivityTrackerAS

Android app originally developed to learn Android programming, but if you are a exercise oriented person (walk, hike, bike, ski,...) this is the app for you!

The app was started way back around 2011 or so. It has been updated to reflect material design features, but architecturely is still based on MVC.

It is updated when time and interest converge.

Interesting code used in this project:

1. SQLite - stores activity info
2. MPAndroidChart - used for charting
3. Google maps
4. Backup/restore to/from Android Drive
5. Use Firebase JobDispatcher and JobService to handle backup
6. Use RxJava/Android for backup and restore.
