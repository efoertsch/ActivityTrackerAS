<p>ActivityTracker was created to learn Android programming.</p>

<p> It is however a very useable app to keep track of your exercise activities. 
Activities can be tracked at a summary level( 
start/finish time and points along with distance covered), 
or at a detail level by recording a GPS track.    
The GPS track can then be used to display the exercise track on Google Maps. 
In addition the details of your activity can be emailed with the GPS track. 
The email recipient can display the track on Google Earth.
</p>

<p>The app comes with default exercises, but you can add new ones as you like.</p>

<p>Five charts are currently available.</p>
 <p> 1. For a particular activity, display distance vs elevation changes (if a GPS track was made.)</p>
 <p> 2. Distance summary by activity for the last month.</p>
 <p> 3. Distance summary by activity for by week.</p>
 <p> 4. Distance summary by activity for by month.</p>
 <p> 5. Distance summary by activity for by year.</p> 
 <p> The distance summaries can be customized by filtering on exercise and location.</p>

<p>The charts are implemented using MPAndroidChart.</p>

<p>A backup of the tracker database is written to your devices local download directory.
 Additionally you can take a backup to Google Drive if you have an account. The Drive backup is taken only when unmetered network access is available.</p>
