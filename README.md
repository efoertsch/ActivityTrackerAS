# ActivityTrackerAS

This app was originally developed to learn Android programming, but if you are a exercise oriented person (walk, hike, bike, ski,...) this is the app for you!

The app was started way back around 2011 or so, updated as time and interest converge. It is slowly being updated to Material Design and current architectural standards.

Main ToDos 
* Use Dagger2
* Convert to DataBinding/MVVM

Interesting code used in this project:

1. SQLite - stores activity info 
2. MPAndroidChart - used for charting
3. Google maps
4. Backup/restore to/from Android Drive
5. Firebase JobDispatcher and JobService to handle backup
6. RxJava/Android for backup and restore.
